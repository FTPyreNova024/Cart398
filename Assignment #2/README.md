The model is classifying a given image to see if its either a Dodge Challenger, a Chevrolet Camaro or a Ford Mustang. I am using a Database of images I found online, I screenshoted them from google images. the three classes are Mustang, Challenger, and Camaro. I gave around 30images per class of various color cars and different angles.

One of the strategies I used to get better results is getting more images of mostly just the front of the cars which is the most identifying part of the cars. I also went from around 10 images per class to 30.
