Code needed to run the application. The Kinect to Wekinator sketch is Gathering the data from the app witht he standard message the app sends being /kinect/bodeis/(bodyID)/joints/(jointiD)/ X Y Z/(IsTracked or NotTracked) from this the sketch selects one of the bodies and gathers all data with the joints id and appends it to a /we/inputs message.
The second sketch is for mapping out the wekinator outputs into more blender compatible inputs. wekinator only sends 0-1 data and blender can have multiple different. an exampl eof this is when dealing with rotation, in order to have full range of motion the mapping is changed to -360 to 360.
